## 📄 

## Executive Summary
****The Challenge:** The Brew Pub

**The Solution:** Developed a custom Python ETL pipeline to process Summer 2025 transactional data, generating actionable insights to identify the top-performing upsell servers.

**The Insight:** Identified a clear path to $3,900 in incremental revenue — unlocked not through new hires or external training, but through the expertise already sitting on our own floor.

## 1. Technical Implementation
### 1.Data Engineering (Python ETL)
*Developed a Python ETL pipeline to extract, clean, and structure data from static PDF reports generated by the POS system.

*Validated data integrity against control totals before loading into **PostgreSQL**

### 2. The Findings 

**Key Insights:**

Identified a clear path to **$3,900 in incremental revenue** — unlocked not through new hires or external training, but through the expertise already sitting on our own floor.

**During medium and high-volume shifts, the performance gap completely collapses**, with all servers reverting to within 6% of the baseline. This proves that individual sales skills disappear under the pressure of a rush.

## 3. Recommendations

**The Wine & Coffee Champion (Server 6):** Server 6 outperforms the house average by a massive 70% in wine and 16% in hot drinks. They should be scheduled to lead a workshop on high-ticket pitching and after-dinner timing.

**The Refill Champion (Server 8):** Server 8 beats the baseline by 27% on second drinks. They should share their exact floor strategy for timing table check-ins during the main course.

**Targeted Coaching for Server 5:** Server 5 consistently falls 6% to 23% below the baseline across all categories. They require dedicated 1-on-1 shadowing to identify where they are missing core sales opportunities.

**Standardize Dessert & Extras Training:** No server significantly beats the baseline for low-friction add-ons (the entire team hovers within 5% of the average). Since there is no internal champion to learn from, management must design and implement a new, standardized pitching strategy for these items.
